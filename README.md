This Git repository stores most of the assignments done in this class. This is a private repository, but because Ming is a collaborator he is able to access the committed files. This repository, as well as Git repositories in general, allow for revision control. This way, I can upload project files to the repository along the way and keep track of progress.

My favorite assignment was assignment 3. Though a bit challenging, I thought it was really interesting to implement the server-side of an application, especially after having already written the client-side. Being able to connect Assignemnts 2 and 3 really solidified my understanding of the interaction between the client and the server.

I think I have grown significantly from day 1 of this course to now. I am now familiarized with many more softwares and languages, and I can assert that I have a basic, foundational understanding of web programming. I think I have also grown in the way I learn information--much emphasis was placed on learning by doing which I find a really helpful and widely applicable skill.

One of the most important things I learned in this course was revision control with Git/Github. Though I would say my relationship with Git is still a bit shaky, I think the concept of revision control is really important. At the beginning of this course, I would only push my assingments to Github once when I was finished, which I realize now defeats the entire purpose of revision control. Now, I commit and push my working files more frequently, and as a result I can keep track of my progress. Additionally, I have learned that Git is useful in group project situations. Since this class began, I have used Git both inside (semester group project) and outside class work. I have learned that it is very helpful when a group is all working from the same repository, because all collaborators have access to the most recent versions of files. Working remotely and separately from group members becomes a lot easier with revision control.

Going forward, I would really like to delve deeper into mobile app development, as well as UI/UX design in general.

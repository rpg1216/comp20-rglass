~Granted extension until Monday, March 12~

1. IMPLEMENTATION
    This website uses two external APIs (google maps and ride request). When the page opens, a map is displayed with my location marker. Depending on whether I am a driver or vehicle, surrounding passengers or vehicles are displayed on the map. Clicking on a surrounding icon displays an info window with the passenger/vehicle user name and distance away from me.

2. COLLABORATION
    I discussed this assignment, in English, with Darby Huye and Matt Manfre.

3. HOURS SPENT
    About 6 hours.

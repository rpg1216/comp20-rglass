~Granted extension until Monday, March 12~

1. IMPLEMENTATION
    As of now, implementation is faulty. The page loads when I am just trying to render a map with my marker on it, however, when I uncomment the other code, the console tells me there is an error with my initMap function, in that the function is undefined. I am still trying to figure this out.

2. COLLABORATION
    I discussed this assignment, in English, with Darby Huye.

3. HOURS SPENT
    Still working... up to now about 4 hours.
